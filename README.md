# nodemcu_temperature_monitor

Here, we added some projects based on nodemcu which interfaces temperature sensor.
  1. temperature_test, this program gets the temperature readings and display it on a serial monitor (Arduino).
  2. temperature_test_server, we create a web server and get those temperature values and displays in a web page with some good GUI.
  3. temperature_test_led_control_server, based on the temperature readings, led will control.
  4. data logging, this will log the temperature data and store it in a SPI Flash file.
